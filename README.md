# üèÄNBA-SHOT-PREDICTION
Predict whether a basketball shot will be successful based on player data, game context, and shot attributes using machine learning.

# Project Overview
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict the success of NBA shots. The dataset contains thousands of shots taken by NBA players, with features such as:
GAME_ID                          
MATCHUP                          
LOCATION                        
W                                
FINAL_MARGIN                     
SHOT_NUMBER                      
PERIOD                           
GAME_CLOCK                       
SHOT_CLOCK                    
DRIBBLES                       
TOUCH_TIME

SHOT_RESULT                      
CLOSEST_DEFENDER                 
CLOSEST_DEFENDER_PLAYER_ID       
CLOSE_DEF_DIST                   
FGM

# üöÄ Objectives
- Clean and preprocess NBA shot data
- Explore and visualize key trends and features
- Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluate and compare model performance
- Predict whether a given shot will go in


# üìà Modeling Techniques
