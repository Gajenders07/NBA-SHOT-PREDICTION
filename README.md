üèÄNBA-SHOT-PREDICTION
Predict whether a basketball shot will be successful based on player data, game context, and shot attributes using machine learning.

Project Overview
This project builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict the success of NBA shots. The dataset contains thousands of shots taken by NBA players, with features such as:
GAME_ID                          
MATCHUP                          
LOCATION                        
W                                
FINAL_MARGIN                     
SHOT_NUMBER                      
PERIOD                           
GAME_CLOCK                       
SHOT_CLOCK                    
DRIBBLES                       
TOUCH_TIME                       
SHOT_DIST                        
PTS_TYPE                        
SHOT_RESULT                      
CLOSEST_DEFENDER                 
CLOSEST_DEFENDER_PLAYER_ID       
CLOSE_DEF_DIST                   
FGM                              
PTS                              
player_name                      
player_id   

üöÄ Objectives
1.Clean and preprocess NBA shot data
2.Explore and visualize key trends and features
